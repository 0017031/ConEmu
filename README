Description
ConEmu starts a console program in hidden console window and provides
an alternative customizable GUI window with various features:

  * smooth window resizing;
  * several panels in one window;
  * easy run old DOS applications (games) in Windows 7 or 64bit OS;
  * tabs for editors, viewers, panels and consoles;
  * thumbnails and tiles in FAR manager;
  * normal, maximized and full screen window graphic modes;
  * window font anti-aliasing: standard, clear type, disabled;
  * window fonts: family, height, width, bold, italic, etc.;
  * using normal/bold/italic fonts for different parts of console simultaneously;
  * cursor: standard console (horisontal) or GUI (vertical);
  * for /BufferHeight mode: vertical scrolling using keyboard;
  * show full output (1K+ lines) of last command in editor/viewer;
  * customizable right click behaviour (long click opens context menu);
  * drag and drop (explorer style);
  * and more, and more... take a look at Settings dialog, WhatsNew and Settings.reg

All settings are read from the registry (multiple configurations are supported) and
after that the command line parameters are applied. Parameters /Config and
/BufferHeight are only for command line. Most of settings are changed only in
the Settings dialog, not from the command line.


Requirements
  * Windows 2000 or later.
