SYNTAX
	ConEmu [/CT] [/FS] [/Font ..] [/Size ..] [/FontFile ..] [/Config ..] [/BufferHeight ..]
	       [/SetParent | /DontSetParent] [/Cmd ..]

PARAMETERS
	/?
	Shows help screen.

	/CT
	ClearType anti-aliasing.

	/FS
	Full screen mode.

	/Font <fontname>
	Specifies the font name.

	/Size <fontsize>
	Specifies the font size.

	/FontFile <fontfilename> - Loads fonts from file.

	/Config <configname>
	Tells to use an existing or create a new configuration with the specified
	name. Each configuration keeps its own individual data in the registry.

	/BufferHeight <height>
	Sets console buffer height and tells to use keys CtrlUp, CtrlDn, CtrlPgUp,
	CtrlPgDn for vertical scrolling. This mode should not be used for programs
	like FAR where buffer and window height are equal.

	/SetParent | /DontSetParent
	One of them may be used to change or not parent for invisible console
	window. Default is "/DontSetParent". You may use /SetParent with ConMan.

	/Cmd <commandline>
	Command line to start. This is the last switch, the rest is treated as a
	command to start and its parameters. By default ConEmu uses a command from
	saved configuration, if any, otherwise it tries to starts Far in normal
	mode or Cmd in /BufferHeight mode.


DESCRIPTION
	ConEmu starts a console program, hides its console window and provides an
	alternative customizable GUI window with various features:

	- smooth window resizing;
	- normal, maximized and full screen window modes;
	- window font anti-aliasing: standard or clear type;
	- window fonts: family, height, width, bold, italic, etc.;
	- cursor: standard console (horisontal) or GUI (vertical);
	- for /BufferHeight mode: vertical scrolling using keyboard;
	- and more, see Settings dialog...

	All settings are read from the registry (depending on a configuration) and
	after that the command line parameters are applied. Parameters /Config and
	/BufferHeight are only for command line. Some settings are changed only in
	the Settings dialog, not from the command line.


COMMAND LINE EXAMPLES
	ConEmu.exe /CT /Font "Lucida Console" /Size 16 /Cmd Far.exe "c:\1 2\"
	ConEmu.exe /Config ScrollMode /BufferHeight 9999 /Cmd PowerShell.exe


ALTERNATIVE BORDER FONT
	This is needed sometimes if you use the option "Fix borders". There are two
	options FontName2 and FontSizeX2 that can be set in the registry manually:

	[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ConEmu]
	"FontName2"="Courier New"
	"FontSizeX2"=hex:0b,00,00,00

	or
	[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ConEmu\<Config>]
	...

	FontName2 is an alternative border font. Default is "Lucida Console",
	perfect in many cases. But for some main fonts, for example "Consolas",
	"Lucida Console" special symbols are wider than needed. In this particular
	case "Courier New" is usually better as FontName2.

	Sometimes even better appearance is possible. FontSizeX2 may help, for
	example: if main font is "Consolas" 16 x 10, then for border font "Courier
	New" FontSizeX2 11 (0xB) is perhaps better.
